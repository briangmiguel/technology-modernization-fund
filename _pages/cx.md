The TMF Board is committed to investing in projects that will deliver a secure, modern, digital-first government experience to the American people. With the TMF funding from the ARP, the Board is focused on investing in projects that will lower the “time tax” for the American public when they interact with their government, as well as reduce administrative burden for the federal workforce. Projects that cut across agencies and systems, address immediate security gaps, and improve the public’s ability to access and manage government services will be prioritized.

Technology underpins Federal agencies’ ability to deliver services to the public. This requires Federal agency Chief Information Officers (CIOs) to partner with their agency leadership and HISP leadership, and their technology teams, to strategically use technology to support the delivery of an outstanding CX.

If you intend to submit a proposal, **please submit your ideas for early feedback** through the TMF CX [Expression of Interest form](https://touchpoints.app.cloud.gov/touchpoints/cfd21923/submit).

### What should agencies apply for?
All projects must be grounded in existing customer research, data analysis, and/or customer-driven business needs, to solve identified pain points or delivery impediments. For projects that need early-phase generative research and design, agencies will need to include a research plan as part of their proposal.

### In addition to the [TMF Criteria]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/criteria.md %}), there are four project areas for priority implementation:
- Design and delivery of cross-agency life experiences, as sponsored by the President’s Management Council.
- Improvement of one or two HISP services, as designated for priority improvement through the annual OMB Circular A-11, Section 280 process.
- Design and delivery of self-service digital tools and services that directly decrease customer call center volume.
- Technology projects that reduce public and administrative burden, as outlined in OMB M-22-10, Improving Access to Public Benefits Programs Through the Paperwork Reduction Act, or technology projects that advance agencies’ equity action plans, as outlined in Executive Order 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government.

### What outcomes should the projects produce?

Projects should focus on the strategic use of technology to improve customer experience, which includes reducing burden on both the public and agencies, and making improvements to non-digital channels like customer call centers. We expect exceptional proposals that outline specific metrics and measurable goals they aim to achieve.

### HISP Portfolio-Level Objectives:

Projects from HISPs should also meet the priority-level success metrics outlined in PMA Priority 2:
- Increasing experience quality to be on par with the best consumer experiences, or other appropriate comparison.
    - Target: Move from last into top 10 on Forrester industry ranking.
- Reducing burden for government’s customers.
    - Measurement: Focus on designated HISP services (near term).
    - Measurement: Focus on designated cross-agency life experiences (long term).
- Improving trust in Government
    - Target: Achieve 75 percent or higher post-transaction trust in HISPs.

### Repayment Guidance
All proposal requests must indicate expected Return on Investment (ROI), including any direct cost savings over at least a 5-year period, to the best of an agency’s ability. If requesting repayment flexibility (i.e., less than 100% repayment), an agency must show either:

- Less than 100% direct cost savings over a 5-year period, and/or
- Justification for some or all of the direct cost savings to go toward reduced user fees, further CX enhancements, or additional deployment and/or growth of shared services. Agencies are expected to use this runway to budget for the sustained reimbursement of these shared services once TMF funds are fully exhausted.
